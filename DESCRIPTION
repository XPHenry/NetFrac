Description: The NetFrac package allows the users to calculate the eight following network 
	distances, NetUniFrac, Motifs, Spp, Spep, Spelp, Spinp, and the Transfer distance (two variants), between 
	species communities present in a given sequence similarity network. The shortest path 
	in a phylogenetic tree is traditionally used to estimate evolutionary distances 
	between species. Moreover, the shortest path concept can be extended to sequence 
	similarity networks. The five following distances (NetUniFrac, Spp, Spep, Spelp, and 
	Spinp) can be seen as network analogues of the traditional UniFrac distance used to 
	assess distances between species communities in a phylogenetic tree, whereas the Transfer 
	distance is designed for estimating the rate and direction of gene transfers, or 
	species dispersal, between different phylogenetic, or ecological, species communities.
