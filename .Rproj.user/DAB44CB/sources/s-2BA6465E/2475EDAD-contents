\title{Shortest path distances
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~

\description{Takes as input the network as well as the species communities to be compared and gives as output the distance matrix between species communities. It is better to use the NetFrac function if the global distances are needed.

%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
