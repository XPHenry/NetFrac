\title{Algorithm for a fast calculation of Transfer distance}
\usage{
transfer2(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The igraph object}
}
\description{
Calculates the Transfer distance as a proportion of the monochrome shortest paths that exists for a given node.
If the threshold alpha is respected, the distance is incremented. The operation is repeated for every node of
the network. The result is a pairwise matrix showing the Transfer distance between each pair of species commmunities.
