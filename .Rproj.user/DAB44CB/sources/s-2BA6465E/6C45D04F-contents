\title{Sequence similarity network distance analysis
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Uses the dist_paths function to calculate distances between different species communities present in a sequence similarity network. It takes as input an igraph object and returns as output distance matrices between species communities.
}
\usage{
NetFrac(x, distances = "Unifrac", paths = "single", maxcores = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{The network(or tree) that will be analyzed. The network must be in the igraph format, the edges being accessible with E(x) and vertices with V(x). The communities are under V(x)$tax and the branch weights under E(x)$weight. These functions are applicable with igraph objects only.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{distances}{Distance(s) to calculate: Transfer, Transfer2, Spaths, UniFrac and Motifs. The transfer, paths and Unifrac distances can also be calculated for trees.
%%     ~~Describe \code{distances} here~~
}
  \item{paths}{this parameter is used to decide whether all the shortest paths between network nodes should be calculated ("all"), or only one of them ("single"). The last option can significantly reduce the time of computation. For Motifs distance, decide the size of the motifs (i.e. 2 or 3).
%%     ~~Describe \code{paths} here~~
}
  \item{maxcores}{uses the multicore function to set up the number of cores to be used
%%     ~~Describe \code{maxcores} here~~
}
}
\details{The Transfer and Transfer 2 distance are based on the number of paths that are not unique to one community. The Spaths distances are different shortest path distances that use different calculation parameters, namely Spp (Shortest path proportion), Spep (Shortest path edge proportion), Spelp (Shortest path edge length proportion) and Spinp (Shortest path internal node proportion). NetUniFrac is a proportion of edges whose nodes belong to the same species community, and Motifs on the motifs present in a network.
